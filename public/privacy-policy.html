<h1>Privacy Policy for Converleon</h1>
<p><strong>Effective date:</strong> 23 November 2025</p>

<p>Converleon ("the App", "we", "us", "our") is a macOS application that helps users convert files between supported formats. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect (if any), how we use it, and your choices.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

<h3>1.1 Files You Convert</h3>
<p>Converleon processes the files you drop into the App solely to perform the requested conversion. Your files are processed locally on your Mac and are not uploaded to our servers.<br>
We do not collect, store, or access the contents of your files.</p>

<h3>1.2 Usage Data</h3>
<p>We do not collect personal usage analytics or behavioral tracking data. The App functions without requiring you to create an account or provide personal information.</p>

<h3>1.3 Purchase and Subscription Data</h3>
<p>If you choose to buy a subscription or a lifetime license, the purchase is handled by Apple's App Store via StoreKit. We do not receive or store your payment card details. Apple may provide us with non-identifying transaction information necessary to verify your access (for example, whether a subscription is active).<br>
Apple's privacy practices are governed by Apple's own policies.</p>

<h3>1.4 Technical Information (Crash Reports)</h3>
<p>Converleon may rely on Apple's system crash reporting. If you opt in to share crash reports with developers in macOS settings, Apple may provide us with limited diagnostic data to help improve stability. This data does not include your file contents.</p>

<h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
<p>We use information only to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Perform file conversions locally on your device.</li>
    <li>Enable and validate paid features through Apple's App Store.</li>
    <li>Improve reliability and fix bugs using anonymized diagnostics (only if you have enabled sharing).</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties.</p>

<h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
<p>Because Converleon processes files locally, we do not store your files on our servers. Converted files are saved only to locations you choose on your Mac.<br>
We implement reasonable safeguards within the App to protect your data on-device, including using macOS sandboxing and user-selected file access.</p>

<h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>Converleon uses:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Apple App Store / StoreKit for purchases and subscriptions.</li>
    <li>Apple system frameworks to perform conversions and system interactions.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not integrate third-party advertising networks, trackers, or analytics SDKs.</p>

<h2>5. Your Choices</h2>
<p>You can:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Use Converleon without providing personal information.</li>
    <li>Choose which files and folders the App may access via standard macOS pickers.</li>
    <li>Disable sharing of crash logs with developers in macOS settings at any time.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>Converleon is not directed at children and does not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

<h2>7. International Users</h2>
<p>Converleon may be used worldwide. Since we do not collect or store personal information or file contents on servers, there is no cross-border transfer of your personal data by us.</p>

<h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update the effective date above. Continued use of the App after changes becomes effective means you accept the updated policy.</p>
